## Final Assignment
Handing a microphone to random people that want to ask questions after a talk, can be a duly task, 
and we want to automatize it. The assignment for the final project is to design a giraffe robot that 
is able to place a microphone in front of a person in a small theatre/conference room. 
The robot is located in the middle of the room and attached to the ceiling. The room is 4 m high 
and the robot should be able to reach 1 m high locations in a 5x12 meters area.
The robot should have 5 degrees of freedom: a spherical joint at the base (2 revolute joints with 
intersecting axes), one prismatic joint that is able to achieve a long extension and 2 revolute joints 
to properly orient the microphone (not necessarily with intersecting axes). 
We want to be able to locate the microphone at any point in the 5x5 conference room, with a certain
pitch orientation (30 deg) with respect to the horizontal (the task is 4D), to allow people to talk 
comfortably in the microphone.
